The File Compressor I created is a highly useful tool designed to significantly enhance data transfer efficiency. 
When dealing with large files, such as a 200MB document, transferring them can often be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

this application addresses that challenge by allowing users to compress these large files, potentially reducing a 200MB file to a more manageable size like 100MB or even 150MB. This reduction in file size directly translates to faster upload/download times and more efficient use of network bandwidth, making data transfers smoother and quicker.

To achieve this, the application leverages two distinct compression algorithms:

Run-Length Encoding (RLE):   Ideal for data with repetitive sequences, offering simple yet effective lossless compression.

LZ77:   A more advanced, highly efficient lossless compression algorithm, widely used in common file formats, ensuring significant size reduction without any data loss.

By providing these robust compression capabilities, the File Compressor aims to streamline the process of moving data, making it more efficient and practical for everyday use.

KEY FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE:

1.Efficient Data Transfer:  data can be trasfered effiently.

2.Dual Operation Modes:  it can compress and decompress the file.

3.Multiple Compression Algorithms:  we can choose the algorithm to compress or decompress.

4.easy to handle:  we can simply choose the file and read the decreption provided for algorithm and choose one.

5.Processing Status & Results:  we can see original size,compressed size,compression ratio,processing time.

6.downloading feature:  we can download the compressed or decompressed file.

TECH STACK USED FOR FROUNTEND:

React:    A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a dynamic and responsive experience.

JavaScript :   The primary programming language for frontend logic and interactivity.

CSS:   Used for styling and ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

TECH STACK USED FOR BACKEND:

Node.js:   The JavaScript runtime environment that powers the server-side logic.

Express.js:   A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to build the API.

Multer:   Middleware for Express.js that handles multipart/form-data, primarily used for file uploads.

CORS: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend across different domains.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN IT LOCALLY:

1.open one terminal and navigate to the backend

use this----> cd ~/file-compressor-project/backend  (give the file names there i chose these).

2.install backend dependencies (if not done yet)

use this-----> npm install

3.start the backend server

use this------->node server.js

4.open another window in terminal and navigate to the frontend

use rhis---->cd ~/file-compressor-project/frontend  (give the file names there i chose these).

5.start the frontend

use this----> npm start
