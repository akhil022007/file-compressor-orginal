The File Compressor I created is a highly useful tool designed to significantly enhance data transfer efficiency. 
When dealing with large files, such as a 200MB document, transferring them can often be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

this application addresses that challenge by allowing users to compress these large files, potentially reducing a 200MB file to a more manageable size like 100MB or even 150MB. This reduction in file size directly translates to faster upload/download times and more efficient use of network bandwidth, making data transfers smoother and quicker.

To achieve this, the application leverages two distinct compression algorithms:
Run-Length Encoding (RLE): Ideal for data with repetitive sequences, offering simple yet effective lossless compression.
LZ77: A more advanced, highly efficient lossless compression algorithm, widely used in common file formats, ensuring significant size reduction without any data loss.
By providing these robust compression capabilities, the File Compressor aims to streamline the process of moving data, making it more efficient and practical for everyday use.
